# Day 1: What is Programming and Python?

### What is Programming?

Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. Computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence we learn programming and tell computers to do what we are very slow at - computation. 

If I ask you to calculate 5+6, you will immediately say 11. 

### How about 23453453 X 56456?

You will start searching for a calculator or jump to a new tab to calculate the same. 
This 100 days of code series will help you learn python from starting to the end. We will start from 0 and by the time we end this course, I promise you will be a Job ready Python developer!

### What is Python?

Python is a dynamically typed, general purpose programming language that supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach. Python is an interpreted and a high-level programming language. It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989. 

### Features of Python:

- Python is simple and easy to understand.
- It is Interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.
- Python is an open-source programming language.
- Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include NumPy, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.
- It is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.

### What is Python used for?

- Python is used in Data Visualization to create plots and graphical representations.
- Python helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.
- It is used in AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard coding.
- It is used to create web applications.
- It can be used to handle databases.
- It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical operations along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.

### What is VS Code?

Visual Studio Code also known as VS Code is a lightweight, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It supports various programming languages along with their extensions, features intelligent code completion, debugging, and version control integration, with a vast marketplace of extensions for added functionality. It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### How to install VS Code along with the Python Interpreter?

#### Step 1: Install Python:

- Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Download the latest version for your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Run the installer and make sure to check 'Add Python to PATH' before installing.
- After installation, confirm it worked by running `python --version` in the terminal.

#### Step 2: Install VS Code:

- Go to the official VS Code website: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Download and install the appropriate version for your OS.

#### Step 3: Install Python Extension for VS Code:

- Open VS Code.
- Go to the Extensions view.
- Search for: Python
- Install the extension by Microsoft.

#### Step 4: Select Python Interpreter in VS Code:

- Open any .py file or create a new one.
- Press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the Command Palette.
- Type and select: 'Python: Select Interpreter'.
- Choose the version you installed earlier.

#### Useful Python Extensions for VS Code:

- Python (by Microsoft): Essential for Python development.
- Pylance: Fast autocomplete and type checking.
- Jupyter: Work with notebooks inside VS Code.
- Black Formatter: Auto-format code.
- isort: Sort Python imports automatically.
- Python Docstring Generator: Quickly create docstrings.
- Code Runner: Run code snippets easily.
