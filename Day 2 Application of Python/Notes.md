# Day 2: My Python Success Story

### Why I love python (And you will too...)?

Welcome to Day 2 of 100 days of code. Let me start with a story! 

Back in my college days, I was deeply involved in C and C++ programming. I spent a lot of time mastering the fundamentals, writing programs with loops, conditionals, and basic printing tasks. And I scored well in my exams, which was great. But, after a while, I began wondering, "What next?" I wanted to take things a step further and actually use the skills I was learning in a real world context.

In my second year of college, I stumbled upon Python. Initially, I wasnâ€™t very good at it, but I could still write basic code for clients. To my surprise, I was able to make decent money doing freelance work without even fully mastering Python. It was this success that sparked my curiosity to dive deeper into the language. As I grew more comfortable with Python, I got into web scraping. This turned out to be a game-changer. I found a great market for it on Fiverr, where I was making money by writing custom Python scripts for clients on a per-webpage basis. It was easy money, and at the same time, I was honing my skills.

From there, I progressed to learning Flask and had the opportunity to collaborate with a university professor abroad. That experience further expanded my knowledge and opened doors to even more opportunities. Long story short, Python played a pivotal role in shaping my career. It gave me the flexibility to work on a variety of projects, helped me earn money, and eventually led me to professional growth.

### What can Python do for you?
